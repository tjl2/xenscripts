== Introduction ==
These scripts are used to build and manage Xen virtual machines on CentOS-based
Dom0 hypervisors.

These scripts were written very quickly to meet tight deadlines and ended up
pretty messy! They work, but will likely need a fair bit of work to run in a
different server environment.

== Virtual Machine/Guest Distros ==
The DomU guests can be various Linux distros, but each distro requires a
'script' creating in the virtual_machine.rb file to work. The distros that
work at this time are as follows:

centos-5-i386
centos-5-x86_64
debian-4-i386
debian-4-amd64
debian-5-i386
debian-5-amd64
fedora-10-i386
fedora-10-x86_64
rhel-5-i386
rhel-5-x86_64
ubuntu-804-i386
ubuntu-804-amd64
ubuntu-810-amd64
ubuntu-904-i386
ubuntu-904-amd64

== Things to know/assumptions about the environment ==

* The scripts create xen blktap file-based disks for the virtual machines and
allow you to specify whether to use SAN storage (assuming it's iSCSI and
available as a mount point) or local storage.
* The scripts assume you have a PXE boot server set up, hosting boot images
(and installation media for the CentOS & RHEL distros).
* The CentOS & RHEL distros are set up using the kickstart method.
* The Debian and Ubuntu distros are set up using the debootstrap method.
* The scripts work on the basis of setting up a 'package' for the guests - the
packages define, RAM and disk amounts

== Config ==
Many of the settings for these scripts are set in a YAML config file, which
needs to be placed in /etc/vmscripts/vmconf.yml
