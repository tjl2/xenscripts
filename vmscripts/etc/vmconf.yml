# Set the paths where images will be stored.
#  local: = path on the local system disk
#  ha: = mounted path on the HA/SAN
#  fdisk_inputs: = where the fdisk input files are stored
#  xen_configs: = where the Xen configs are stored
paths:

# Nameserver IP addresses. These are the IP addresses that
# will be used by our VMs in their resolv.confs
# Each one must be two spaces in and begin with a '-'
nameservers:
  - 8.8.8.8
  - 8.8.4.4

# Default domain. When using vmcreate, the name of the VPS
# will be combined with a domain to create a fully-qualified
# domain name.
domain: example.net

# The xen hypervisor servers in your cluster. Each one must
# be connected to the shared storage. You must also
# ensure that SSH keys are set up between these machines
# so that they can scp files to each other without prompting
# for passwords
xen_servers:
  - xenserver1.example.net
  - xenserver2.example.net
  - xenserver3.example.net

# Network settings. Define your allowable networks here. You can only use IP
# addresses with the vmcreate script that are part of one of these defined
# networks. The networks need to be an array of hashes, with each
# hash key being one of the following:
#  'network' needs to be the first 3 octets of the network
#            (must be a string in quotes)
#  'start' is the first allowable IP in the network (must
#          be a single integer)
#  'end' is the last allowable IP in the network (must be
#        a single integer)
#  'nmask' is the netmask (must be a string in quotes)
#  'gway' is the network gateway (must be a string in quotes)
#  'type' is either 'bridged' or 'routed', depending on your xen network policy
# Example:
# networks:
#   -
#     network: '10.0.0'
#     start: 1
#     end: 253
#     nmask: '255.255.255.0'
#     gway: '10.0.0.254'
#     type: bridged
#   -
#     network: '10.0.1'
#     start: 1
#     end: 125
#     nmask: '255.255.255.128'
#     gway: '10.0.1.126'
#     type: routed
networks:
  -
    network: '10.0.0'
    start:   1
    end:     253
    nmask:   '255.255.255.0'
    gway:    '10.0.0.1'
    type:    bridged
  -
    network: '10.0.1'
    start:   1
    end:     253
    nmask:   '255.255.255.0'
    gway:    '10.0.1.1'
    type:    routed

# Package settings. Provide package details: name, memory and
# storage size here. The packages should be an array of hashes,
# with each hash key being name, mem, swap & storage. The
# mem & swap values should be in MB. The storage should be in
# GB. Example:
# packages:
#   -
#     name: pkg1
#     mem: 512
#     swap: 1024
#     storage: 10.0
